# PlaceholderChat

PlaceholderChat
This plugin allows you to create custom chat formats.
It's like EssentialsXChat but with PlaceholderAPI:

*The config key "user", "admin" is the permission group name*

**DEPENDENCIES**: PlaceholderAPI, Vault, any permission plugin that hooks into Vault

# Commands & permissions:
**/placeholderchat** (Shows the credits)
**/placeholderchat help** (placeholderchat.help) (admin command)
**/placeholderchat reload** (placeholderchat.reload) (admin command)


# WARNING:
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ALL THE **PlaceholderAPI** ADDON INSTALLED, IF NOT, INSTALL THEM WITH "*/papi ecloud download [...]*" THEN EXECUTE "*/papi reload*" and "*/placeholderchat reload*"

**IF THE PLUGIN DOES NOT WORK CHECK THE CONSOLE!!!**
Maybe you don't have installed the PAPI packages
